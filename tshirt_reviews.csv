Andy's Reviews,"Reviewed in Canada on November 30, 2019",Shirt as dark as the future of Earth,5.0,"I bought these shirts because the graphic tees I've worn since the 9th grade (I'm 25) no longer cut it. I'm supposed to be an adult (we all know this is Fake News), and can't be wearing a shirt that says ""Vote for Pedro"" on it to a business meeting. Who am I kidding, though. I haven't ever attended a business meeting - thanks for ruining the economy, mom and dad! Needless to say, I'm the freshest looking guy in my Social Justice class now. This was the perfect amount of shirts, now that I don't have to choose which shirt I want to wear in the mornings I can spend more time thinking about where I'm going to buy my Avocado Toast.",508,1

VT,"Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2020",Good shirt for the price,4.0,"I ordered these to wear while I workout and do lawn work.  The Dry Fit (polyester) irritates my skin.  These claim to have moisture wicking technology, but I've never heard of cool spire.  The only cotton wicking technology I've heard of is wicking windows and transdry (charged cotton).  I have no idea which one Cool Spire is based off of.  6 shirts for the price of $22 is good.  None of the shirts have a defects with the stitching like others have claimed, and the sizing is right.  I like the length of the shirts, they are not too long that they almost go down to your knees, but they are long enough that if you raise you arms, they still cover your mid section.  The quality of the cotton is fine, it isn't the softest, but I've had far worse.  I'll say it is average to slightly above average.  I've purchased white undershirts from Gildan in the past, they are the same quality as their regular shirts, but not as soft as their premium shirts.  The only negative I would say is that they don't look exactly like the pictures.  In the pictures the body portion looks more fitted, in reality the body portion is simply straight down, but I was expecting that based off other reviews.ProsGood quality for the priceI found the fit to be accurate to the sizing chartlength of shirt is goodNone of the shirts had any defects that others have claimed.ConsSoftness of cotton is average to at best slightly above average.Shirts are not as depicted in the photos.

He outside all day and white is better in the summer (works construction). So the feel of them is great, not too thick, not too thin. They’re a great fit in him. He’s 6”2. But the most annoying thing is that some of the shirts have the label printed on the front of the collar. Like it’s been stamped??? See the picture.

I got the large and out of the package they looked and fit great. However after two washes, they fit like a smaller medium and the length is too short for me now. They look like garbage as around the neck they are fraying already. I will definitely not recommend these to anyone.

A. R,"Reviewed in Canada on August 2, 2019",Fantastic for work undershirts,5.0,"Hubby wears out shirts luke their going out of style so decided to try these on a whim and we both absolutely love them. He likes the fact they are simple black tshirts, not too heavy or too thin on fabric, and they fit awesome. They are pretty long (medium was just about crotch length on 5'8"" hubby) but he likes them longer so they tuck into work pants nicely. I love the fact that at $22 for a 6 pack, it works out to $3.50 a shirt. SOOOOO much better then him destroying a nice tshirt that runs $25/shirt.We will be stoking up on these for sure!",35,1
Chris,"Reviewed in Canada on February 10, 2020",Honest,5.0,"Last review you need to read about these tshirts..Other than fact they are about 2 inches longer than they need to be, they fit perfect.The only caveat is that if you wash in hot water they shrink about 2 inches in length.  I bought packs of white and black..  Black washed in cold...same length as original after washing. When comparing the black to the white tshirts washed in hot water, you can see clearly see a difference in length.All above being said, I would buy thrm again as they are decent quality and even if they shrink due to washing in hot water they come out same length as other brands.",24,1

Stephen Boulton,"Reviewed in Canada on May 4, 2019",Good shirts for the price,5.0,"The size chart is pretty accurate.  I'm a big guy that usually borders on large to extra large.  I got XL assuming there would be some shrinkage in the wash.  When I got the shirts originally, they were pretty large both in length and width.  They did shrink quite a bit in the wash, but I would probably still go with L if I get them in the future.  Otherwise, they are nice shirts.  The material is comfortable and the colours look good.",21,1

G Anderson,"Reviewed in Canada on April 30, 2021",Low quality,1.0,"When I removed the clear tape holding the first shirt into its little ball the cloth ripped. Hard to believe a material can be so flimsy that a bit of tape adhesive is enough to tear it! I haven't even opened the other four yet, and will have to be extremely careful with the tape removal, hopefully I salvage four good ones. But I am not optimistic that these will last very long. The material is extremely thin. I should really return them but maybe I'll get some (careful!) use out of the others. The fit is fine, pretty much as described. Too bad about the quality tho. I can't recommend these.",6,1

Not the thinnest, but not the thickest either.  Good as undershirts in my opinion.Sizing is good.Grey shirt has some stretch to it.No tag, silk screened label instead.Made in Bangladesh.The only question left is how do they wash?  Will they shrink?  Time will tell, but initial impressions are very good.",5,1
James Heater,"Reviewed in Canada on June 8, 2019",Recommended,5.0,"I bought these not expecting too much but new shirts since mine don't fit as I've put on alot of weight. The quality of them is on-par with your average Walmart shirts but noticably thinner, which is good for the summer. They fit well off the start, haven't washed them yet and tried them on (as they're cotton and cotton shrinks a bit), but I believe that they'll shorten up in length a fair bit (they're a bit long) but I would definitely recommend buying a size larger than usual. As of right now I can wear large t-shirts, bordering into XL depending on who made the shirt, and I bought large after reading the reviews about them being somewhat smaller than usual. They fit quite well, but again unsure of how they'll fit after I washing.I would recommend buying a size larger if your current shirt size is bordering on restricting (shirt doesn't flow freely down your torso) as I believe they'll shrink a fair bit after being washedOther than those observations I would say that for the price and quality it's worth buying a pack!",11,1
Tristan Cuschieri,"Reviewed in Canada on October 27, 2020",Great Value,5.0,"The shirts themselves are great - high quality, and comfortable.  As you've probably already read, they are NOT pre-shrunk, so expect them to shrink if you throw them in the dryer.I'm 5'6 130lbs, and I ordered small size, completely underestimating the shrinkage factor.  Prior to shrinking, they fit PERFECTLY, and were extremely comfortable.  After washing/drying, they shrank noticeably at the shoulders/arm length, making them feel a little too constrictive for me.  However, given that I bought them to wear while sleeping, I just took some time to stretch out the fabric a bit (carefully), and found that they became comfortable again.One last point - the reason I bought these as sleep shirts was for the moisture wicking (as I tend to sweat at night while I sleep).  I have found that I am noticeably more comfortable during the night wearing these shirts, compared to the other ones I usually wear, despite my sweating.  That makes a huge difference to the quality of my sleep and the number of times I wake up as a result throughout the night.  So for anyone who has the same problem, I don't think you'll be disappointed by this.Just keep in mind - if you wear a small size and plan on drying these with the rest of your clothes in a dryer, I recommend ordering a medium.",2,1

I have under armour T-shirts that fit the same way everytime I put them on and do not parachute through out the day at the bottom.

They also stretch out around the arms/shoulders through out the day..  My shoulder's are much bigger then my mid section so its not my body stretching them out.BAck to the hunt for a T-shirt that doesn't stretch out as you wear them!",0,1
Jason,"Reviewed in Canada on July 3, 2022","Great shirts, but issue with quality control",3.0,"Ordered these shirts because I know gildan shirts fit the way I want them too. However one black shirt in the pack is not the same size as the other shirts, including the other ""identical"" black shirt in the pack. Even though the shirt is tagged as a medium, The one shirt is about an inch shorter and the sleeves are also about an inch short, so it bunches up in my armpit and sits weird on my shoulders. So unfortunately I only got 4 wearable shirts. Which I turn makes it less of a good deal. Which I'm not thrilled about. It's too bad because I love these shirts. I still recommend them but Quality control is an issue.EDIT: every shirt shrunk after wash. The length is still acceptable, but the sleeves are pretty much crammed into my armpit. So these are clearly not pre shrunk. Advice I guess would be to buy a size larger? I'm torn I still like the feel of the shirts but this is a bit discouraging.",0,1
Quinn,"Reviewed in Canada on June 19, 2021","Good Quality, Good Price",4.0,"These sre good quality shirts. It's a nice blend of fabrics that give a strong hold without being thick or rough to touch. They fit as expected and I only have two complaints. There was some stitching that came lose unser the inner arm seam after just one use (Only on one of the shirts). Also they hang much lower than I am used to sitting half way down my jean pockets. I am 5,10 as a reference and have never had that problem with shirts that fit my chest.

Vaxster,"Reviewed in Canada on January 4, 2021",Over-rated,3.0,"5 years ago I purchased similar George brand t-shirts from WalMart, went back looking for same but couldn't find any so purchased these end of October 2020 after reading the reviews, but these pale in comparison to the basic George ones. Overall the fabric is thinner, especially noticeable around the neck which is fraying already, but I think the most telling feature of low quality of these t-shirts is the amount of lint that stays attached after removal from my clothes dryer. Nothing else comes out of my dryer with lint attached anywhere near these shirts. I suspect it's because of a rougher surface that catches the lint so even though the t-shirts feel soft to the touch, they must be made of an uneven fabric. Quite displeased with this attribute so will not re-purchase and won't recommend to family members.",One person found this helpful,1
ReD4Zone,"Reviewed in Canada on August 21, 2022",Seriously for the price,5.0,It fit just right for a casual tshirt. They arent fancy but useful for everyday at home or chill. The quality is good. It's not a 60$ tshirt but it's what a plain solid tshirt should be.  I have a hard time with the designer clothes this days being all super slim. I am not fat but again I am not slim and this fit just ok. For the price you can't complain and you shouldnt feel bad either.Good buy ! It was fast and well packaged.,0,1
Tee Ehm,"Reviewed in Canada on June 2, 2019",Good quality. Happy with this purchase.,4.0,"These shirts are lighter weight (thinner material) than what you'd expect from a regular t-shirt. That being said, they're perfect to wear as an undershirt, but you could also wear them as a regular t-shirt. The collar sits the same as a regular shirt, not lower like some undershirts. I usually wear XL so that's what I ordered. When they arrived they looked huge, at least a 2XL. After one wash/dryer cycle there was a bit of shrinkage, but that's to be expected with 100% cotton. These now fit me perfectly with the shrinking from the wash. Time will tell how well these hold up, but I'm not too concerned because I paid about $22 for 6 shirts. In my books that's very reasonable. The quality is definitely better than I expected. I'm definitely ordering more.",3,1
CK,"Reviewed in Canada on July 9, 2020",Best fitting shirt I've bought yet!,5.0,"I typically have a very hard time buying shirts. I have a taller frame, so I end up having to buy shirts a size bigger to fit the length of my body and arms. These shirts fit me very well, long enough in the body while still being a slimmer fit, sleeves are a good length, but I wish they were a little longer. I feel if I ordered a size bigger, the sleeves would have been perfect but the body would have been too wide and long.",4,1
Marc Chouinard,"Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2021","Benchmarked, great buy!",5.0,"There was some mixed reviews about this pack so I did some testing :-)BEST Result: Wear it once for a day before washing, wash warm+dryer will keep the same size, no shrink. Cold water had the same results (Black / dark grey)GOOD Result: Washed warm and dryer, did shrinked a bit,  but was able to strech (light grey / black / dark grey)I am between L and XL, and a pack of L fit perfect.  The light grey *seems* a bit smaller, but could be an illusion (noticed before and after wash so it's not a shrinking issue). The only negative thing (which is also a positive), it's very thin, so yes it's comfortable but it won't last forever compared to thicker versions. Worth the price",0,1
David Laliberte,"Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2021","Price, Quality and shipping big plus. Very pleased.6",5.0,"What can I say that best describes this product. First price excellent. Second the quality excellent cotton and fit. I'm 6'1 and 190 lbs. Average upper body size. I ordered the XL 46-48 size because that's all they showed at time of purchase. They fit well, but haven't washed them yet. Hopefully, they won't shrink too much. I have a little to play with as I don't like tight fitting t shirts to start with. As for price 5 shirts for $25 how can you go wrong. If they do shrink after washing them then, I'd still reorder again but go for 2X if available. Shipping was fast around 10 to 12 days.

Amosobadias,"Reviewed in Canada on February 18, 2021",Pay more if you want quality,3.0,You get what you pay for here. Lots of loose thread so you basically need to finish making these yourself by turning inside out and trimming all the dangley thread. And for some reason these collect a lot of lint in the wash and come out of dryer covered in it. Nothing but these t-shirts picks up all the lint. So they require a lot of lint rolling after washing.

AL,"Reviewed in Canada on April 29, 2021",Terrible cutting and fit,1.0,"I don't know who Gildan uses as a template for their cuttings but that guy must be an out of shape man who never hits the gym - narrow shoulders and big stomach.

K Edstrom,"Reviewed in Canada on December 9, 2020",Would Buy Again,5.0,"These shirts are really soft and very comfortable. I bought them for myself during pregnancy so I would have something that fit but wasn't cut for a female. The black one really holds on to dog hair, even when washed. That is my only complaint, but I always where black around my golden retriever so it doesn't even bother me that much. They are a really good length - long, but straight so they fit nicely instead of hanging off of your hips.",0,1

Aji,"Reviewed in Canada on July 4, 2021",Better than expected (longer in length),5.0,I was skeptical at first buying shirts online especially in bulk but I was surprised at the comfort and the length. The shoulder fits perfectly and the length was longer than expected which is what I actually wanted. I searched other reviews on this but never mentioned. Its long in the length than the average t-shirt so you can tuck in with ease and have it loose out fine too which covers more,0,1

Paolo Bramucci,"Reviewed in Canada on September 25, 2021",Classic T-shirt!,5.0,"I have long liked this brand. Their t-shirts are well made. The fabric is soft right from the beginning and over time with washing tends feel softer. The weight of the cotton feel just right.Also, the collar is sits a top the shoulders at the base of the neck perfectly. Moreover, even after washing it width remains wide at above 2cm (3/4 of an inch), which I find looks good when worn under an open collar shirt, such as a polo, or, button down Oxford shirt.With regard to the, I find that the small fits my small athletic body type well, that is close, but not tight or binding.As t-shirts go, this what I am looking for. I am a t-shirt and jeans guy, so these are very much my daily wear. They will easily last for 3+ years, if laundered as per instructions and continuing to look good.At the current price they are great value for the money.",0,1

Regardless, the weight gain gave me a small pot belly and a lot of my old undershirts don't feel long enough anymore. Constantly riding up and I'm always pulling them down. Annoying. I've been looking for a comfortable, flattering fitted, but long t-shirt to wear around the house while I work and workout.These shirts nailed everything. Solid thickness, good stretch, perfect fit, awesome length...and it worked out to be around $4.50 CAD a shirt which is a fantastic deal.  Really couldn't be happier here. If you're a tall guy who likes a good fitted tshirt that has enough length to wear standalone or be tucked as an undershirt this is what you want. When the black comes back in stock in XL I'll be buying another 12 pack.",0,0

D. Hill,"Reviewed in Canada on June 16, 2022",Comfortable and affordable,5.0,"Purchased two sets of the Black and one of the White.The fit well for the size ordered, and is a lighter material than the Gildan Heavy Cotton most of my nerd shirts are.  I wanted something plain, since the overwhelming majority of my tees are Geek Chic prints and images.  The White shirts are a nice change from a decade of all black wardrobe as our summers get toastier.I have not encountered much shrinking.  After any wash, the fibers are a bit tighter, but a GENTLE stretch and it's fine.  I have noticed in the year and a half since my first order, the collars are starting to loosen a bit.  This is something that happens over time, but these are inexpensive shirts and well worth it.Over the three orders, my first set of 6 Black was $24.65, next was $25.99 bundled with 6 White for $26.99.  If the price floats a bit, wait until lower.  For a just over $4 tee, this is unbeatable",0,1
Lee,"Reviewed in Canada on March 12, 2021",Realize that these are $4 t-shirts and you won't be disappointed,3.0,"So it's $20 for 5 of them making each shirt $4.  As long as you are aware you're buying a $4 shirt you won't be disappointed.  After just washing them once, all the threads are hanging from the neck and the waist and they have all lost their shape even air drying.  There's always loose threads just hanging from it like they are coming apart.  They are find if you needed a shirt to wear one time or something but spend a bit more on some good quality shirts if you want them to last as these are really only good for maybe yard work or something.  They are basically the t-shirts you see on a rack in Chinatown.",0,1

ZM,"Reviewed in Canada on September 12, 2019",Bang for the buck!,5.0,"If you're buying these solely to use as a type of undershirt or work shirt, $20 for 5 of these is a bang for your buck.
